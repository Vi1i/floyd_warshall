# OpenMPI implementation of Floyd's Algorithm

## Question
Consider a classical algorithm in the domain of graph theory.  Implement Floyd's Algorithm for finding All-Shortest-Paths in a graph. Use OpenMP and choice of platform and language. The main idea is to experiment with different number of vertices *n*, different numbers of threads *t*, and possibly different threading scheduling/synchronization models.

## Objectives
* Verify the correctness of parallel implementation against the sequential version of code
* Conduct a performance evaluation, concentrating on Speedup (i.e. sequential vs. parallel execution time)
* Graph results to help explain/communicate your observations
